# SQL-Excel-Covid Deaths Project


In this SQL-Excel project, using the deaths and vaccination data tables of Covid-19 from March 2020 to June 2021, I've done an exploratary analysis SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

I used MS-SQL Server and imported the Excel files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.

I used Deaths Analysis Project on Excel Dashboard.
