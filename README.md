# SQL-Excel-Covid Deaths Project


This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of global COVID-19 deaths and vaccination trends from March 2020 to June 2021. The datasets, sourced from Our World in Data, were initially in Excel format and later imported into Microsoft SQL Server for deeper analytical processing.

Using SQL queries, I explored key metrics such as total deaths, mortality rates, vaccination progress, and country-wise comparisons over time. After processing the data in SQL, I visualized insights using an interactive Excel dashboard, specifically focusing on death trends, vaccination coverage, and time-based analytics.

This analysis bridges data engineering (using SQL) with business intelligence (via Excel), offering an intuitive understanding of the pandemicâ€™s impact across different regions.
